# Handoff

Handoff is the exchange procedure between the restaurant and deliverer, and deliverer and customer, to confirm the recipient is correct. The approach will be consistent with our handoff approach in the other apps, to meet with pre-existing expectations the various users (restaurant, customer, etc.) of the platform have.

This approach falls under two main use cases regarding the end customer, **on device** where the device is present and in-use, **off device** where the device is not present or not functional (dead battery, no internet, etc.).

### On Device

If the recipient's device is within a certain vicinity to the exchange, the party handing over the good will prompt the recipient's device to show the verification screen. This screen will show the unique colour and serial associated with that order.

#### Restaurant to deliverer

Restaurant performs the handoff verification check for the order, the deliverer's app will show the unique screen.

#### Deliverer to Customer

Deliverer performs the handoff verification check for the delivery, the customer's app will show the unique screen.

### Off Device

Alternatively the recipient may share their secret phrase in order to verify who they are.

#### Deliverer to Customer

Customer tells the deliverer their phrase, who confirms that is the secret phrase for that user.
