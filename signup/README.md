# Login / Signup

The general process is a login/signup prompt (like other apps) to access (or create) the user's identity on the platform. Then if the user has any required accounts still pending, the app will present those relevant setup screens. Otherwise if the accounts have all been correctly setup and verified, it will open to the main application content.
