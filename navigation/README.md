# Navigation

Directions will be shown for the path the user should take to complete their current list of jobs. The path will be dependent on the mode of transport they're taking, the order of their jobs, and outside variables (road works, traffic, restaurant ETAs, etc.).

The path should be dynamic and re-plot itself based job re-ordering, user going off the path, or delays (restaurant delays).
