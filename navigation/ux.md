# UX

Single screen with dropdown view to provide access to most content without having to leave the map. The map will be the main focus of the screen, while the active job list will be minimised.


## Map

The map will feature the current path the user is encouraged to take to take them through all of their jobs. With the current job the in focus (highlight).


## Current Jobs

The list of currently assigned jobs will be minimised showing only the current task being performed (top priority).

The list can be expanded to half the screen (reducing size of the map) to view the entire list of tasks. These tasks are split into each destination. For example:

1. 123 Something St - Restaurant - \#12
2. 124 Something St - Restaurant - \#15
3. 500 Some other St - Customer - \#15
4. 540 Some other St - Restaurant - \#20
5. 505 Some other St - Customer - \#20
6. 200 Some Rd - Customer - \#12

Tasks can be reordered by selecting one to focus on, this will make the task (or dependent task) the first priority before the others.
