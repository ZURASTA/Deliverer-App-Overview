# UX

Single screen to minimise navigating between views. Where the jobs are presented in a list, where each item in the list is a single job prompt. _And a button to temporarily turn off incoming jobs.?_


## Job

The jobs are ordered from most recent to oldest. Where an incoming job has a time-limit for which it can receive a response.

The job will display its fee, the attributes of the order (hot, cold, delicate), the amount of space the order will approximately take up, the location of it relative to their current jobs, and the additional amount of time taking this job will add to their current jobs.

#### Response

To respond to the prompt, the user will swipe to accept or decline it. This reduces the risk of accidentally performing the wrong action, and should be quite a simple action to perform without focusing too much on it.

#### Location

A map indicating in relation to their current list of jobs, where the new job will take them will be used to show the location. This makes it easy to discern spatially where the job will be located in-relation to the current path they'll be taking.


## Current Job Overview

For reference, a sum of the attributes, capacity, and other features of their current jobs will be shown. Reduces the need for them to remember what their current jobs will require of them.
